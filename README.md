The Horiseaon Refactor 

Overview 

This repository is where you will find the corrected code for Horiseon. The purpose of this project was to correct code that was undescriptive for the website of Horiseon. Fixing the code within html and css made it easier to interpret what was being displayed on the webpage. 

The issue was primarily by simplifying duplicate codes into one, adding alt tages to images that weren't implemented before, and changing simple div tags into descriptive semantic html. The goal was achieved while keeping the integrity of the website.
